# How the Web Works from request to response?

# What is Server Side vs Client Side Rendering when to use one over other? 

# How does the user is authenticated? auth2.0 explian? what is JWT token?

# Single Page Application vs Multi page Application
#### Single Page Application(SPA)
When we are switching between the pages. single page application will make a request to server to fetch data along with related Javascript files and assets. 
From javascript files routing will be applied and changes will be re rendered into the DOM.

- SEO search is Challenging
- Javascript is strictly required
- SPA Highly reactive and faster
- Decoupled frontend
#### Multi Page Application
- SEO is simple
- It is slower (bcz in case of SPA atleast we fetch parts of page) bcz everything has to be fetched from the server
- Tightly coupoled front end and backend
# Dynamic vs Static vs Single page Apps?
